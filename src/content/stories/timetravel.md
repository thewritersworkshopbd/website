Many years ago, doctor george wanted to invent time machine. The next day, he tried to make his old car to a new car then suddenly he saw a monitor has turned on front of him. In the monitor, He saw **Past or future** written in the monitor. then, he clicked at past. 100 years ago, then the time machine started. he saw a portal. he went inside that portal. then he saw a old man standing in front of him. the man said who the f### are you? then doctor said I'm mr, george who the hell are you? then, he said I'm luisa. and I'm also a gay. The doctor said why the F### you said that **you are a gay?** the man said because I wanted that you know everything about me lol. then dr said **are you f##### idiot?** the man said **yes, you're right** the dr said, **i'm a time traveler from the future** then the man said **oh, welcome you're also a moron like me and my girlfriend** then dr said, do you want to see **I can go to future** then the dr turned but he didn't saw a portal. the dr said **WTF**

The end.
